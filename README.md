# Quant Trading Strategies
I defined different strategies on historical/real-time market data and conducted backtesting for strategies such as SMA, Bollinger Bands, logistics regression and deep neural network. Then, I applied the strategies to automatic trade on my TradeWorkstation using paper trading account. This project is about defining different strategies on quantitative trading, therefore i only started trading session and end trading session within 5 minutes, therefore the trade reporting on the uploaded notebook does not reflect the true PnL of the strategies. The trading session can be adjusted 24/24 by changing ending session to 24 hours in the .py trader file, along with that AWS EC2 can be used to trade automatically.
